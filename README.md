# 30 APIs in 30 Days

It's getting too cold to do anything productive outside, and I've got a week-long holiday break coming up soon, so I think it's time for a little personal challenge. I've been kind of fascinated by APIs for awhile, the way the good ones manage to hide unknown complexity behind a wall of simplicity. In an ideal world anyway.

Before I started my current job, I wasn't completely sure what an API was. If you're in the same boat, consider how your car's dashboard hides the complexity of hundreds of sensors and electronics under the hood. You can GET the current speed or outside temperature, and SET the cruise control speed or radio station. It's an interface to a more complex system, so you don't have to sweat the details.

In a similar fashion, an API lets you GET data out of a system and POST data into it. I've been involved with writing an API, have used a number of them, and I've even [written about them](https://grantwinney.com/what-is-an-api/). But over the next 30 days I'll try to write about 30 _different_ APIs - how to get started using them and hopefully some demos - and I'll make it all available on here as well as [on my blog](https://grantwinney.com/tag/30-apis-in-30-days/).

## Getting Started

[Download Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) so you can try these out yourself. Postman is a tool that allows you to make API calls without having to implement code in any particular language, and it's great for trying things out. Of course, if you want to do anything with the results of those API calls, then you'll need to pick a language to use them in.
