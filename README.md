# 30 APIs in 30 Days

It's getting too cold to do anything productive outside, and I've got a week-long holiday break coming up soon,
so I think it's time for a little personal challenge.
I've been kind of fascinated by APIs for awhile, the way the good ones manage to hide unknown complexity behind a wall of simplicity.
In an ideal world anyway.

Over the next 30 days [I'll try to write about 30 different APIs](https://grantwinney.com/a-new-challenge-30-apis-in-30-days/), including how to get started using them and demos if possible. I'll make everything available on here and [on my blog](https://grantwinney.com/tag/30-apis-in-30-days/).

## Getting Started

[Download Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) so you can try these out yourself. Postman is a tool that allows you to make API calls without having to implement code in any particular language, and it's great for trying things out. Of course, if you want to do anything with the results of those API calls, then you'll need to pick a language to use them in.

## Getting Going

- Day 01 (Dec 16) - [Twitter API](Day%2001%20-%20Twitter.md) ([blog](https://grantwinney.com/day-1-twitter-api/))
