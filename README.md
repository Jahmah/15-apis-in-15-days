# 30 APIs in 30 Days

It's getting too cold to do anything productive outside, and I've got a week-long holiday break coming up soon,
so I think it's time for a little personal challenge.
I've been kind of fascinated by APIs for awhile, the way the good ones manage to hide unknown complexity behind a wall of simplicity.
In an ideal world anyway.

Over the next 30 days I'll try to write about 30 _different_ APIs with a little demo of how to use each one.

- Day 1 - Twitter API

- Day 2 - ???
